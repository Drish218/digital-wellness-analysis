Digital Wellness Report: Correlation & Platform Risk Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview & Business Value
This project utilizes Python (Pandas) analysis results to create a two-page Business Intelligence dashboard in Tableau. The goal is to provide data-backed insights into which usage behaviors and social media platforms most strongly correlate with user happiness and stress levels. The report is essential for establishing effective digital wellness policies and targeted interventions.

Page 1: Executive Correlation Summary
This page focuses on the statistical relationship between key usage metrics and the reported Happiness Index, using the correlation matrix dashboard.

Key Analytical Takeaways
Primary Risk Factor (Strong Negative): Daily Screen Time shows the strongest negative correlation with the Happiness Index (-0.74). This indicates a highly predictive, inverse relationship: as daily screen time increases, reported happiness significantly decreases.

Primary Protective Factor (Strong Positive): Days Without Social Media (+0.73) is the strongest positive correlation, closely followed by Exercise Frequency (+0.65). These factors should be prioritized in wellness campaigns.

Recommendation: Efforts to improve wellness must focus on reducing overall screen time and promoting regular 'digital detox' days.

Page 2: Platform and Usage Risk Analysis
This page dissects wellness scores across specific social media platforms and identifies critical usage thresholds to guide targeted intervention strategies.

Key Analytical Takeaways
Lowest Risk Platform: Users primarily on LinkedIn reported the highest average Happiness Index (9.00) and the lowest average Stress Level (5.00). This suggests platforms focused on professional or goal-oriented use are less detrimental to mental health.

Highest Risk Platforms: TikTok and Instagram correlate with the lowest average Happiness Index scores (5.00 and 5.50, respectively) and the highest average Daily Screen Time (7.60 and 6.65 hours). These are high-priority targets for intervention.

Critical Usage Threshold: The analysis identified a sharp drop-off in happiness when daily screen time exceeds 6.5 hours. This metric should be established as the critical risk threshold for future monitoring and programmatic alerts.
